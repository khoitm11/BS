# Black-Scholes Option Lab üß™üìà‚ú®

Welcome to the **Black-Scholes Option Lab**! This project is an interactive and educational environment designed for students, financial market enthusiasts, quantitative analysts, and anyone curious about the world of options. Dive deep into the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulate dynamic market movements, analyze option sensitivities (the Greeks), and explore concepts of potential trading edges.

Our lab is meticulously crafted with a robust Python backend, features a high-performance FastAPI for service-oriented architecture, an engaging Streamlit dashboard for real-time analysis and visualization, and integrates MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking.

*   **üöÄ MLflow Integration:** Systematically log, track, compare, and manage different simulation experiments, including parameters, metrics, and visual artifacts (results are stored locally in the `mlruns/` directory).
*   **üåê FastAPI Backend Service:** A powerful API providing endpoints for:
    *   Option Pricing (Call/Put)
    *   Greeks Calculation
    *   Market Data Fetching (via `yfinance`)
*   **üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit Interactive Dashboard:** A sophisticated, user-friendly web interface offering:

    *   Dynamic input of custom option parameters (S, K, T, r, œÉ).
    *   Instantaneous display of calculated Call/Put prices and all associated Greeks (data fetched via API calls to the FastAPI backend).
    *   Stunning, interactive Plotly charts visualizing how Greeks respond to changes in the underlying asset price.
    *   An auto-refresh mechanism for market data, giving a "live trading desk" feel.
*   **üê≥ Dockerized Applications:** Production-ready Dockerfiles for effortless containerization and deployment of both the FastAPI API and the Streamlit Dashboard.
*   **ü§ñ CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** A fully automated pipeline for linting (Ruff), formatting checks, and running unit tests, ensuring code quality and stability.
*   **‚ú® Clean Code & Comprehensive Unit Tests:** Emphasis on well-structured, readable, and maintainable Python code, backed by thorough unit tests using `pytest`.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Your Journey Begins Here!

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10 or higher
*   Pip (Python package installer)
*   Git version control
*   Docker Desktop (Optional, but recommended for running containerized applications and a full experience)
*   An IDE like PyCharm or VS Code is highly recommended for development.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, get a local copy of the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khoitm11/Black_Scholes_option_lab.git
cd Black_Scholes_option_lab
```

### 2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

Isolate your project dependencies using a virtual environment. This is a best practice.
```bash
# Create a virtual environment ('.venv' is a common name)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment:
# On Windows (PowerShell/CMD):
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):
source .venv/bin/activate
```
*(You should see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.)*

### 3. Install All Dependencies

Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Unit Tests (Ensure Stability!)

Verify that all core components are functioning as expected:
```bash
pytest
```
*(All tests should pass with green lights!)*

---

### 5. Dive into Jupyter Notebooks for Exploration

JupyterLab provides an excellent interactive environment to explore the project's logic.
```bash
jupyter lab
```
This will open JupyterLab in your default web browser. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to begin your exploration.

---

### 6. Launch the FastAPI API Service (Local)

The API backend serves calculations and data.
- Run from the project root directory:

```
uvicorn app.api.main_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
*   The API will be live at `http://localhost:8000`.
*   Interactive API Documentation (Swagger UI): `http://localhost:8000/docs`
*   Alternative API Documentation (ReDoc): `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

---

### 7. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard (Local)

Experience the interactive UI. **Ensure the FastAPI service (Step 6) is running** as the dashboard will call it for data. (Verify `API_BASE_URL` in `app/dashboard/main_dashboard.py`).
Run from the project root directory:
```bash
streamlit run app/dashboard/main_dashboard.py
```
The dashboard will typically open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### 8. Track Experiments with MLflow UI (Local)

After executing notebooks that utilize MLflow (e.g., `03_mlflow_tracking_for_edge_sims.ipynb`):
Run from the project root directory (where the 'mlruns/' directory is created):
```bash
mlflow ui
```
Access the MLflow UI in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5000`, to review your experiment runs.

---

### 9. Running with Docker (Optional - Full Containerized Experience)

Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your system.

**a. Build the API Docker Image:**
```bash
docker build -t blackscholes-lab-api:latest -f Dockerfile_api .
```

**b. Run the API Docker Container:**
```
docker run --rm -d -p 8001:8000 --name bs_api_container blackscholes-lab-api:latest
```
*(The API will now be accessible at `http://localhost:8001` on your host machine).*

**c. Build the Dashboard Docker Image:**

```
docker build -t blackscholes-lab-dashboard:latest -f Dockerfile_dashboard .
```

**d. Run the Dashboard Docker Container:**
Example for Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) where API container is mapped to host port 8001:
```
docker run --rm -d -p 8502:8501 --name bs_dashboard_container -e API_BASE_URL="http://host.docker.internal:8001" blackscholes-lab-dashboard:latest
```
*(The Dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:8502` on your host machine).*
*Note on `API_BASE_URL` for Docker: `host.docker.internal` allows a container to reach services running on the host (including other containers mapped to host ports). If using custom Docker networks, you could use the API container's service name.*
